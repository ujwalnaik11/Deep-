# Deep-Learning
This repository will house all codes, data, files related to my work in Deep Learning

## 1. Neural Style Transfer : 
For a given content image and a style image, generated a target image that minimizes the content difference with the 
content image and the style difference with the style image using VGG19 CNN model.
### Key skills:
* Pytorch
* CNN

## 2. Image Search Engine : 
Implemented a content based image search engine using Keras that uses VGG16 CNN model to extract deep features 
from images and then retrieve related images. Designed a web interface using HTML and used Flask for API endpoints
### Key skills:
* Deep Feature extraction
* Flask

## 3. Movie Recommendation System
Collaborative filtering is a method of making predictions about the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users.

### Key Skills:
* Collaborative Filtering using FastAI
