# Deep-Learning
This repository will house all codes, data, files related to my work in Deep Learning
***
### [1. Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/ujwalnaik11/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Neural%20style%20transfer)
For a given content image and a style image, generated a target image that minimizes the content difference with the 
content image and the style difference with the style image using VGG19 CNN model.
#### Key skills:
* Pytorch
* CNN
***
### [2. Image Search Engine :](https://github.com/ujwalnaik11/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Image%20Search%20Engine) 
Implemented a content based image search engine using Keras that uses VGG16 CNN model to extract deep features 
from images and then retrieve related images. Designed a web interface using HTML and used Flask for API endpoints
#### Key skills:
* Deep Feature extraction
* Flask
***
### [3. Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/ujwalnaik11/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Collaberative_filtering.ipynb)
Collaborative filtering is a method of making predictions about the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users.

#### Key Skills:
* Collaborative Filtering using FastAI
